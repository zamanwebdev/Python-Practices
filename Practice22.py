# Python - Loop Lists
# You can loop through the list items by using a for loop:
LoopList = ["mahi","sabnnur","bobita","porimoni","Mahjabin"]
for Prem in LoopList:
    print(Prem)
# Use the range() and len() functions to create a suitable iterable.
for i in range(len(LoopList)):
    print(i)
# Print all items, using a while loop to go through all the index numbers
y = 0
while y < len(LoopList):
    print(LoopList[y])
    y += 1
