# Python Comparison Operators
x = 5
y = 3
# (==) Equal Comparison Operators
print(x == y) # returns False because 5 is not equal to 3
# (!=) Not equal Comparison Operators
print(x != y) # returns True because 5 is not equal to 3
# (>) Greater than Comparison Operators
print(x > y)  # returns True because 5 is greater than 3
# (<) Less than Comparison Operators
print(x < y) # returns False because 5 is not less than 3
# (>=) Greater than or equal to - Comparison Operators
print(x >= y) # returns True because five is greater, or equal, to 3
# (<=) Less than or equal to Comparison Operators
print(x <= y) # returns False because 5 is neither less than or equal to 3
